# API DOCUMENTATION
---

TODO: Show the endpoints that we'll be building in a table or in a screenshot. 

TODO: Set up Swagger here for screenshots? Prepare for documentation of api endpoints. Talk about best practices of documenting as you build the api.


TODO: Possibly link to a deployed version of the API. Kenn or Paul can look into this with the Heroku versions.
