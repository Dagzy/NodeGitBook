---

In this module we're going to give you enough to get by with SQL basics.

### Basic Query

TODO: Monica is making basics for this.....She has them in another book.....We should grab them from her. We need to grab create table, query a table, insert an item into a table, etc. Just basic stuff.

NOTE: We don't want to go overboard here because we want them just getting a feel for it. More on SQL later....

TODO: Just show how to see some data in Postgres.

Do a query for users, do a create, etc.
