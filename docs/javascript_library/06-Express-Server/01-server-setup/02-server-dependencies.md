# SERVER PACKAGES
---
In this module we'll set up a few of the server packages that will be used in this application.

### What is a dependency?
A dependency is a necessary requirement for a class or interface to use.<br>
It is like this: if you have a TV remote, you also need the dependency of batteries; you cannot use the remote without also using those batteries.  Furthermore, you cannot continuously reuse that remote unless you also coninuously reuse those batteries.  And, if your batteries fail, you can no longer use your remote.

### Project Dependencies

| Package       | Purpose    | 
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| bcrypt        | Password-specific hashing that protects your password from being stored in plain text |
| body-parser   |  |
| dotenv        |  |
| express       |  |
| jsonwebtoken  |  |
| pg            |  |
| pg-hstore     |  |
| sequelize     | something |

### npm init
Let's initialize `npm` as our package manager for our dependencies. To initialize npm in the application, go through the following steps:

1. Open the `server` folder.
2. Open the command line window.
3. Run `npm init`.
4. Hit enter through all the prompts. 
5. You should see a new `package.json` file in your `server` folder.

### package.json
TODO: Check on newer versions of these packages.
1. Take out the contents of the `package.json` file.
2. Replace the contents with this code:  

```json
{
  "name": "workoutlogserver",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "server for workout log app",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node ./node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server"
  },
  "author": "YOUR NAME HERE",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "bcryptjs": "^2.4.0",
    "body-parser": "^1.15.1",
    "dotenv": "^4.0.0",
    "express": "^4.13.4",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^7.2.1",
    "pg": "^4.5.6",
    "pg-hstore": "^2.3.2",
    "sequelize": "^3.23.3"
  }
}
```

3. Run `npm update`. This will read all of the new dependencies above and load them all in the node_modules folder. 
4. Know that adding these new packages to `package.json` file allows us to freeze the particular versions of each dependency so that they harmonize together without breaking the application. For instance, letâ€™s say that dependency bcrypt has changed to `3.0.0` and the new version does not work well with sequelize `4.0.0`. Such a change might break our app. 

We'll talk about what these dependencies do as we go through this application.
