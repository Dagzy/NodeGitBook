#### fetchFromOneDisplayData()
The last couple of functions received data back from the database and printed it to the console. This time, we actually display that data. We use a `for of` loop to iterate through the response object and create an `<li>` element for each item, which are then added to the `<ul>` object to be shown to the user.
