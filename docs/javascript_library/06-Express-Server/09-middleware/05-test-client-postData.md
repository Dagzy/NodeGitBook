### postData()
This function will allow us to add content to the database instead than just retrieving it. We have a pre-defined object that we pass into the `fetch` with the `body` property. Notice that the `method` property is now `POST` instead of `GET`. Our response is printed to the console, then also displayed to the user along with the timestamp.
