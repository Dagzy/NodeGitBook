# POSTMAN INTRO
---
In this module we'll introduce Postman, a tool for testing our back-end as we build it.

<hr />

### About Postman
Building a back-end is a little more abstract than building a front-end. In a web application we can see changes as we make them: a color, a button, an image. With the back-end we need a way to test our code as we build it to ensure that we are on the right track. Postman is a great tool for that job.

### Helpful Features
Postman provides back-end developers with an enormous amount of value, including the following items:

1. Ability to test endpoints.
2. Can fully log in to an application and save data to a database without having to have sign in or sign up forms. 
3. Code can be written and run directly from postman to control external servers, devices, etc.
4. Collections of api endpoints can be saved and tested simultaneously.
