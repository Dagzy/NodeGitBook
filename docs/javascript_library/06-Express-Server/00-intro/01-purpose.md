### Big Objectives
There will be a lot covered in this chapter. As you proceed, you'll start to see how things are connected, but slow down and take your time if you have trouble comprehending any of it. <br>

Important Stuff:
* Building your own API endpoints and routes with Express
* Using tools to test those endpoints
* Using `fetch` for more than `GET` requests: `POST`, `DELETE`, `PUT`
* Start to use sequel (SQL) statements and sequelize to enter and retrieve information into databases
* Setting up security protocols and authentication for individual user accounts
* AND MORE
