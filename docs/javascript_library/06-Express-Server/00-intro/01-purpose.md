### Client/Server Model
Where, with the API lessons and challenge, we interacted with the client side, here, we will be connecting and building on the back-end using Postman and PostgreSQL.

### Big Objectives
There will be a lot covered in this chapter. As you proceed, you'll start to see how things are connected, but slow down and take your time if you have trouble comprehending any of it. <br>

Key Objectives:
* Build your own API endpoints and routes with Express
* Use tools to test those endpoints.
* Start to use SQL statements and sequelize to enter and retrieve information into databases
* Set up security protocols and authentication for individual user accounts
* Build an demo api for a Workout App that implements MVC patterns and includes proper routing, authentication, and persistence.
