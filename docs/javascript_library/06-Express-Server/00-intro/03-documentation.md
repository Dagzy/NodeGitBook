# API DOCUMENTATION
---
In this module we'll talk about documentation and give a high level view of what our routes and endpoints will look like with our Server. 

<hr />


TODO: Show the endpoints that we'll be building in a table or in a screenshot. 

TODO: Set up Swagger here for screenshots? Prepare for documentation of api endpoints. Talk about best practices of documenting as you build the api.


TODO: Possibly link to a deployed version of the API. Kenn or Paul can look into this with the Heroku versions.
