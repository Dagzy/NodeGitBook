# API DOCUMENTATION
---
In this module we'll talk about documentation and give a high level view of what our routes and endpoints will look like with our Server. 

<hr />


TODO: Paul will work on this: Show the endpoints that we'll be building in a table or in a screenshot. 

TODO PAUL: Set up Swagger here for screenshots? Prepare for documentation of api endpoints. Talk about best practices of documenting as you build the api. Haven't done this yet.....Paul will work on. https://blog.cloudboost.io/adding-swagger-to-existing-node-js-project-92a6624b855b


TODO: Possibly link to a deployed version of the API. Kenn or Paul can look into this with the Heroku versions.
