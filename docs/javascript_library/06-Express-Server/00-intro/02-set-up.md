# FILE STRUCTURE
---
In this module, we'll set up our file structure for our Server. 

<hr >

### File Structure
Create the following folders and files in your JavaScript library:
```
    javascript-library
        └── 4-Node-Fundamentals
        └── 5-Express-Server
            └── server
                └── .gitignore
                └── app.js
```

### .gitignore

1. Add `node_modules/` to your `.gitignore`. Again, anytime you work with npm packages, it's best practice to include this in your `.gitignore`. If you forget, hundreds or thousands of extra, unnecessary files will be pushed to your GitHub repository. <br>
Simply add the following to the `.gitignore` file: `node_modules/`

2. `app.js` can be left blank for now.
